# 👋 Hi, I'm Lizhong(Zoe) Wang

Building AI-native products that turn messy information into structured insight.

## What I'm Building

**[Content Creation Agent](https://github.com/AgentMind-Studio/content-creation-agent)** — Research-backed video script pipeline
Web search → fact extraction → cross-domain analysis → script generation. Turns 40+ articles into a 10-min YouTube script with cited sources in 4 minutes.

**[AI Infrastructure Research Agent](https://github.com/Pickle1024/ai-infrastructure-research-agent)** — RAG system for market intelligence
Ask questions like "What's the capex trend for AI data centers?" and get answers with auto-generated visualizations from earnings calls, reports, and market analysis. Tracks the AI infrastructure stack from chips to power.

**[Anthology-AI](https://github.com/Pickle1024/Anthology-AI)** — Time-aware news mapping
Tracks how topics evolve across years by mapping scattered news into structured timelines.

**[InsightFlow-AI](https://github.com/Pickle1024/InsightFlow-AI)** — Conversation insight extraction
Pulls structured insights from AI chat sessions for social media content.

**[Yapyap-AI](https://github.com/Pickle1024/Yapyap-AI)** — Voice conversation practice
Gamified sandbox for practicing conversation skills with AI voice feedback.

## Content Creator

Former education content creator on Xiaohongshu (小红书). Now preparing to launch AI infrastructure content on YouTube—breaking down complex technical topics (chips, data centers, energy, market dynamics) into data-backed, accessible analysis.

The [Content Creation Agent](https://github.com/AgentMind-Studio/content-agent) above is built to support this: research → script → quality evaluation, all with human review at every step.

## Philosophy

> In the age of AI, the bottleneck isn't coding—it's clarity of thought and speed of iteration.

I believe we're in the early stages of a fundamental shift in how intelligence works. Instead of predicting what happens next, I'm building things that help me understand it better—tools for content creation, research, and analysis at both the application and infrastructure layers.

Every project starts with identifying where human judgment adds value, then uses AI to handle everything else.
