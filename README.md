## 🎯 Philosophy

> "In the age of AI, the bottleneck isn't coding—it's clarity of thought and speed of iteration."

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Every project here represents an experiment, a learning moment, or a problem I wanted to solve. Some are polished, some are works-in-progress, but all represent progress.
