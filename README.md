**Product Builder | AI Learner | Turning Ideas into Reality**

I'm exploring how AI transforms product development and sharing what I learn along the way. I believe in building in public, rapid iteration, and leveraging AI to move from idea to execution faster than ever.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Build AI-powered tools** that solve real problems
- **Analyze & visualize data** to drive product decisions  
- **Create content** about AI, product thinking, and building in public
- **Ship fast** using AI-assisted development and rapid prototyping

## 💡 Product Skills

Beyond coding, I bring product thinking to everything I build:

- **Product Analytics & Data-Driven Decision Making** - Turning data into actionable insights
- **User Research & Customer Discovery** - Understanding what users actually need
- **Product Roadmapping & Strategy** - Prioritizing what to build and why
- **Rapid Prototyping** - From wireframe to working prototype in hours
- **Product Storytelling** - Communicating value through content and demos
- **AI-Native Development** - Leveraging LLMs for 10x faster iteration

---

##  🎯 Current Focus

- **Learning:** How to leverage AI for rapid product development
- **Building:** AI-native tools and workflows that solve real problems
- **Exploring:** The intersection of product management, data analytics, and AI

> "In the age of AI, the bottleneck isn't coding—it's clarity of thought and speed of iteration."

I believe the best way to learn is by building. Every project here represents an experiment, a learning moment, or a problem I wanted to solve.
